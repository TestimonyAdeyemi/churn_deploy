* This notebook focuses on the project's initial phase, where the data is collected and understood.
* Covers data preparation steps, including handling missing values, duplicate values, transformation of the dataset to be structured for modelling and preprocessing.
* Provides insights into the dataset's composition, distribution, and the rationale behind data cleaning decisions using Exploratory Data Analysis.

**Preprocessing and Model Training Notebook** [Link to Notebook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zuIf3mU-Je-e8SvK5qqsmZamgR3OJ1K1/view?usp=sharing)
* This notebook delves into the preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for model training including splitting the data, encoding, scaling, handling class imbalances
* Training and Validation Testing on Multiple Models
* Includes discussions on optimization strategies, custom metrics, and model evaluation.
* Offers a comprehensive overview of the end-to-end process, from data preprocessing to training a robust Telecom Churn Prediction model.
